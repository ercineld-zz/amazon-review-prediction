Amazon Product Reviews and Helpfulness Score
## Abstract

  Product reviews and ratings are popular tools to support buying decisions of consumers. These tools are also valuable for online retailers, who use rating systems in order to build trust and reputation in e-commerce. Many online shops offer quantitative ratings, textual reviews or a combination of both. This project aims to provide statistical insights into Amazon product reviews dated from May 1994 to July 2014, examine their helpfulness in recommending products, suggest a new way to predict helpfulness score of the user reviews.

  The number of reviews on Amazon has grown significantly over the years. Customers who made purchases on Amazon provide reviews by rating the product from 1 to 5 stars and sharing a text summary of their experience and opinions of the product. The ratings of a product then are averaged to provide an overall product rating. We analyzed how Amazon customers write reviews and what type of ratings they give in a specific category in order to find underlying statistical trends providing insights into inner workings of Amazonâ€™s review system. We trained various classifier models using a training set of preprocessed reviews. The classifier predicts whether the review is helpful or not. The performance of the classifiers was tested on a test set containing 30% of the dataset.
